All ciphers can be defined as two functions, one called the enciphering function that takes a plaintext as input and outputs a ciphertext, and one called a deciphering function that takes a ciphertext as input and outputs the plaintext.

For convenience, some common notation is used:

{\centering
	$p$ is the plaintext.\\
	$c$ is the ciphertext.\\
	$k$ is the secret key.\\
	$E(p)$ is the enciphering function.\\
	$D(c)$ is the deciphering function.\\
}


\section{Transposition Ciphers}
A transposition cipher is a permutation of the plaintext.

\section{Substitution Ciphers}

\subsection{Shift Ciphers}
Shift ciphers work by shifting the symbols in the plaintext by an amount. For example, if we are using the English alphabet, then there are $n=26$ possible symbols. We could then choose some $k$, $0<k<n$ for our key. In our notation, this would look like
$$E(p_i,k)=p_i+k\text{ (mod $n$)}.$$ (possibly cite abs alg textbook here?)
To get the deciphering function, we shift backwards:
$$D(c_i,k)=c_i-k\text{ (mod $n$)}.$$


Shift ciphers are broken by frequency analysis. Below is a table that shows the letter frequency from a sample of English text.
