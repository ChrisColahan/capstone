%This is a blank document for homework assignments.

%Some preliminaries:  Anything after a '%' is a comment - it isn't read by 
%the compiler.  

%You are welcome to skip down to lines 38-44 to put in some information, and 
%then to line 57 to start writing, but the preamble contains all the 
%formatting that makes it look nice, if you're interested in how that works.

%Packages are just collections of commands to do different things.  For
%almost anything you might want to do, there's a package that will do it.
